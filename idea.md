Agentic Research Paper Intelligence Platform

Overview

Core Features & Detailed Workflow

1. User Authentication & Profiles
 • Users register/login with email and password (JWT-based).
 • User profile stores preferences, recent activity, and learning goals.
 • Authentication secures all endpoints and personalizes the experience.

2. Paper Upload & Processing
 • Users upload PDFs of research papers.
 • Backend extracts metadata (title, authors, abstract) and full text using ‎`pdfplumber` or ‎`PyMuPDF`.
 • Paper is stored in ‎`/storage` and indexed in SQLite.
 • On upload, the backend:
 ▫ Automatically triggers summarization (LLM via Groq+LangChain).
 ▫ Generates study notes, flashcards, and a mind map.
 ▫ Embeds paper sections into vector store (ChromaDB/Pinecone) for semantic search.

3. My Papers & Paper Management
 • Users see a library of uploaded papers, each with metadata and status.
 • Selecting a paper loads its context into the chat interface.
 • Users can delete, rename, or update papers.
 • All paper data is linked to the user profile.

4. Chat-Based Q&A (with RAG)
 • Users interact with a chat interface to ask questions about any paper or across their entire library.
 • When a question is asked:
 ▫ LangChain retrieves relevant paper chunks (via vector search).
 ▫ Groq LLM answers the question using retrieved context (RAG).
 ▫ Answers are shown as AI chat bubbles.
 • Chat history is stored per user and paper for continuity.

5. Study Planner & Agentic Workflow
 • Users set study goals (e.g., “Master GANs in 2 weeks”).
 • The platform’s agent (via LangChain) analyzes the user’s papers and goals, then:
 ▫ Suggests a reading schedule based on paper complexity and deadlines.
 ▫ Automatically schedules sessions and reminders.
 ▫ Tracks progress and adjusts the plan if the user falls behind or completes tasks early.
 • Planner integrates with the chat: users can ask for updates, reschedule, or get recommendations.

6. Notes, Flashcards, and Mind Maps
 • For each paper, the backend generates:
 ▫ Concise study notes and key takeaways.
 ▫ Flashcards (Q&A pairs) for active recall.
 ▫ A mind map (JSON structure for frontend visualization) showing key concepts and relationships.
 • Users can review, edit, or export these materials.
 • Materials are linked to the study planner (e.g., flashcards for upcoming sessions).

7. Insights & Proactive Agentic Features
 • The platform proactively:
 ▫ Flags novel findings, contradictions, or gaps between papers.
 ▫ Surfaces trends or recurring themes across the user’s library.
 ▫ Sends weekly digest emails with new insights and study progress (optional).
 • Insights appear in a dedicated sidebar section and can be loaded into the chat for discussion.

How Features Work Together
 • Agentic Workflow: The platform is not just reactive; it acts as a research partner. Uploading a paper triggers automatic processing and content generation. Setting a goal activates the agent to plan and guide study sessions, adapting as the user interacts.
 • Chat as the Hub: All major actions—Q&A, planner updates, insight discussions—happen through the chat interface, making the experience unified and intuitive.
 • Semantic Search & RAG: Every Q&A leverages the vector store for context-aware answers, ensuring responses are specific to the user’s library.
 • Proactive Support: The system monitors user activity and research content to offer timely suggestions, reminders, and insights.

Tech Stack
 • Frontend: Next.js (TypeScript, dark chat UI, shadcn/ui or Chakra UI)
